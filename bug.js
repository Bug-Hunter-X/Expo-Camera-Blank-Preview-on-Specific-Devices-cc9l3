This bug occurs when using the Expo's `Camera` API with specific device configurations, resulting in unexpected behavior such as the camera preview not displaying or showing a blank screen. The problem seems to be related to how Expo handles camera permissions and the underlying camera hardware on certain devices.  The error messages are not always consistent, making debugging challenging. Sometimes, there's no error message at all, just a blank preview.
