# Expo Camera Blank Preview Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. On certain devices, the camera preview remains blank, with no clear error message. This issue seems to be tied to interactions between Expo's camera permissions handling and specific device hardware. This repository contains both the problematic code and a potential solution to this unexpected behavior.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a device experiencing this issue.
4. Observe the blank camera preview.

## Potential Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file contains a potential workaround for this bug. The core change involves a refined approach to permission handling and fallback mechanisms.  More testing is needed to confirm its effectiveness across all affected devices.
